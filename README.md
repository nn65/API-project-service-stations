# Algorithm and data structures project
## Introduction
[Here](https://github.com/nn65/API-project-service-stations/Utils/specs.pdf) you can find all the specifications about the project. Evaluation: 30/30.
## Requirements
The goal of this project was to develop a highly optimized program. It must meet certain memory and time requirements to be as fast as possible and use the minimum amount of memory. A variant of the dijkstra algorithm was developed, using the distance from the starting node to find the minimum distance. A pointer to the previos station was added in order to print the path in reverse order.

All the algorithm and data structures were obtained from the book "Introduction to algorithm", Cormen-Leiserson-Rivest-Stein.
